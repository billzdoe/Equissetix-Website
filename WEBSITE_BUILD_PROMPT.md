- **Vibrant Blue:** #2563EB (trust, technology, professionalism) - Information accent

**Neutral Colors:**

- **Warm Gray:** #334155 (backgrounds, subtle elements)
- **Light Cream:** #F8FAFC (light backgrounds, contrast)
- **Pure White:** #FFFFFF (sparingly, for maximum contrast)

**Color Usage Strategy:**
- Use vibrant colors for CTAs, key features, and interactive elements
- Create color-coded sections for different feature categories
- Use gradients and color transitions for depth and movement
- Avoid white backgrounds - use colored backgrounds (light cream, warm gray, or subtle gradients)
- Ensure high contrast for readability (WCAG AA compliance)

#### 2. TYPOGRAPHY
**Primary Font:** 
- **Outfit** (Google Fonts) - Modern, geometric, professional, excellent readability
- Weights: 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 600 (SemiBold), 700 (Bold)

**Secondary Font:**
- **JetBrains Mono** (for data/metrics/technical content) - Monospace, technical feel

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- H1: 3.5rem (56px) - Bold, impactful hero headlines
- H2: 2.5rem (40px) - Section headers, feature titles
- H3: 1.875rem (30px) - Subsection headers
- Body: 1.125rem (18px) - Comfortable reading size for 30-50 age group
- Small: 0.875rem (14px) - Supporting text, captions

**Typography Style:**
- Sharp, clean lines (no rounded letterforms)
- Generous line-height (1.6-1.8) for readability
- Letter-spacing: -0.02em for headlines (tighter, modern feel)
- Letter-spacing: 0.01em for body text (slightly wider for readability)

#### 3. SHAPE & CORNER STYLE
- **Sharp Corners Only:** All elements use sharp, 90-degree corners (border-radius: 0)
- **No Rounded Elements:** Buttons, cards, images, containers - all sharp/angular
- **Geometric Shapes:** Use triangles, diamonds, sharp-edged polygons as design elements
- **Angular Accents:** Sharp diagonal lines, angular dividers, geometric patterns
- **Modern Edge:** Creates a fresh, cutting-edge, professional aesthetic

#### 4. MOVEMENT & ANIMATION
**Animation Philosophy:** The website should feel alive and dynamic, not static

**Required Animations:**
1. **Hero Section:**
   - Animated gradient backgrounds (slow, continuous movement)
   - Floating elements (subtle up/down motion)
   - Text reveal animations (fade + slide)
   - Parallax scrolling effects
   - Animated statistics counters

2. **Feature Sections:**
   - Scroll-triggered animations (fade in, slide in from sides)

   - Interactive cards that lift/transform on hover
   - Animated icons (subtle pulse, rotation, or morphing)
   - Progress bars that animate on scroll

3. **Data Visualizations:**

5. **Micro-Interactions:**
   - Button hover effects (scale, color shift, shadow)
   - Form field focus animations
   - Loading states with animations
   - Success/error message animations
   - Smooth page transitions

**Animation Guidelines:**
- Duration: 0.3s - 0.6s for most interactions
- Easing: Use cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) for smooth, natural motion
- Performance: Use CSS transforms and opacity (GPU-accelerated)
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility
- No jarring or excessive animations - smooth and purposeful

#### 5. LAYOUT & SPACING
- **Generous White Space:** But use colored space, not white
- **Grid-Based Layout:** Clean, organized, professional
- **Asymmetric Elements:** Break grid occasionally for visual interest
- **Sharp Dividers:** Angular section dividers, not curved
- **Card-Based Design:** Sharp-cornered cards with shadows/elevation
